        "1. Whatis Object- Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is the usage of objects to deisgn and structure our code. This helps in our code being resuable, organized and easy to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- The class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single\n",
        "entity. For the production of objects, classes serve as blueprints or code templates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- It is an instance of a class.  It consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried\n",
        "out using a class's object\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstarction- It hides comples information and shows only necessary info.\n",
        "- Encapsulation- It protects data by resrict direct access and allow modification by methods only.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dundler methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods\n",
        "that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__). These methods allow us to define how\n",
        "instances of our classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance in Python refer to the process of a child class receiving the parent class's properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsualtion achieved in Python?\n",
        "-  A class's data members and methods can be made private or protected in\n",
        "order to achieve encapsulation. Direct access modifiers like public, private, and protected don't exist in Python,\n",
        "though. Single and double underscores can be used to accomplish this.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- **Class methods**- Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "- __Static Method__- Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-  Method overloading is the practice of invoking the same method more than once with different parameters. Method overloading is not supported by Python, it only takes into account the most recent definition. If we overload a method in Python, a TypeError will be raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in Python?\n",
        "-  In Python, method overriding is the process of providing a different implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass within a subclass. It enables the subclass to define its own version of a method with the same name and parameters as the method in the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is property decorator in Pyhton?\n",
        "- The @property decorator allows us to define a method that acts like an attribute, so we can access it without parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in Python?\n",
        "- polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly used to create objects. It contains abstract methods that must be implemented in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Code reusability (Inheritance), Better data protection (Encapsulation), Easy to update and manage, Organized and modular code.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared among all objects of the class.\n",
        "- Instance variable: Unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- One child class may inherit from several parent classes when there is multiple inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Expalin the purpose of \"__str__'and'__repr__\" methods in Python?\n",
        "- __str__(self): This method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return a string representation of the object.\n",
        "- __repr__(self): This method is called when the repr() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return an unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to ecreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Pyhton?\n",
        "- super() helps access methods from the parent class without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. WHat is the significance of the __del__ methods in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a destructor that runs when an object is deleted, helping in cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod: It is a general utility method that handles a single task. Since this method is static and doesn't have access to class attributes, we don't use instance or class variables within it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod:  used to access or alter the class state. If we exclusively use class variables when implementing a method, we should declare that method as a class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Inheritance is the primary application of polymorphism. The traits and methods of a parent class are passed down to a child class through inheritance. A subclass, child class, or derived class is a new class that is created from an existing class, which is referred to as a base class or parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Pyhton OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method allows an object to be used like a function, meaning you can call an instance as if it were a function.\n",
